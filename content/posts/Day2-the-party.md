# Day 2 - Meet the Party

## Irben Wyatt - Human Cleric - 17 years old

Irben has been a devout member of the Church of the Nameless as long as he can remember. Born to a mother that died in childbirth, his overwhelmed father requested he be raised by the clergy. By tradition, Irben's father was denied further access to his upbringing, and Irben was never told which member of the town is his father, though he has his suspicions about the blacksmith, Braeden, a lifelong bachelor with no family to speak of that is always mostly quiet when Irben is sent to request new horseshoes.

Many of Irben's generation have their doubts about the Nameless Ones, and Irben can understand why. There aren't as many miracles as the tales suggest their should be in the world. Unlike his contemporaries, however, Irben's faith does not waiver as he has actually felt the presence of the gods. Although he has his doubts about the Nameless Ones, he does not doubt the fact that something is there. It itches at his brain.

## Acca Lamb - Human Thief - 19 years old

Acca has always been a bit more of an outlier in her town. At the age of 12, her father was banished beyond the veil for his accidental murdering of a fellow townsman. She and her mother, while still allowed to live in town, were made pariahs. Acca learned quickly that the work she and her mother performed was not being fairly compensated to maintain their lives, and Acca took matters into her own hands to survive. Accordingly, she has become quite adept at strategically finding misplaced items that the owners have apparently forgotten about in order to make her family's lives, and bellies, rest a bit easier.

Having been the only witness to the accident that led to her father's banishment, and knowing that the truth is an injustice, Acca follows no god. She also holds out hope that her father, the bravest man she ever knew, survives past the veil.

## Diera Nolley - Human Magic User - 18 years old

Diera has a problem. She knows there's something more. She can hide it for now, because it has only happened while she was alone. However, there is a strange whisper in her mind. It is herself, this she knows beyond doubt. The Nameless Ones have nothing to do with this. But these whispers... Recently she listened closely while everyone else lay sleeping. The results were some scribbles on paper that seemed meaningless, but made absolute sense to Diera.

It almost looked like a crude drawing, done by a skilled, yet bored, hand. To Diera's mind, though, the image had words that went along with them. Not words, exactly, but sounds that she could make, nonetheless. Curious, she made these sounds, and instantly fell asleep. When she awakened, she remembered what had happened, and looked upon the... drawing? She couldn't remember the words she spoke, but as she gazed upon the inscription on the page, they began to return to her mind. That night, she was tasked with caring for her infant brother. Frustrated with the crying that didn't seem to want to stop, she spoke the words once again. Her brother was asleep. And she could no longer remember the words. 

This has scared Diera, and she doesn't want to hurt her brother. Or anyone for that matter. But how to stop the whisperings? Using the incantations seems to quiet the voice, but it always returns.

## Ord Lyone - Human fighter - 20 years old

The son of the local sherrif, Ord is set to follow in his father's footsteps. He hopes to be more fair than his father, though. No one knows, but he was a witness to the incident that led to the incident that led to the banishment of the Lamb patriarch. He told his father about this, but was told not to interfere in the workings of the Council. The sherrif's job was to enforce, not to create law. Ord is quiet for now, but disagrees. He believes now that his father just relishes being a bully for the Council, but Ord craves the day when he can bring actual justice to the proceedings by allowing other voices to be heard.

## Poppy - Female Halfling - 28 years old

Poppy, typical of Halflings in the town, does not carry a surname. From a family of hunters and artisans, she is as comfortable with her crossbow as she is with tools. Unlike most of the Halflings, she tires quickly of the jests, and has been known to have to be ... contained ... due to fights in the local gatherings. Usually, she is able to even the odds with the larger folks due to her penchant for wrapping her knuckles, though.
