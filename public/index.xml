      <description>Day 2 - Meet the Party Irben Wyatt - Human Cleric - 17 years old Irben has been a devout member of the Church of the Nameless as long as he can remember. Born to a mother that died in childbirth, his overwhelmed father requested he be raised by the clergy. By tradition, Irben&amp;rsquo;s father was denied further access to his upbringing, and Irben was never told which member of the town is his father, though he has his suspicions about the blacksmith, Braeden, a lifelong bachelor with no family to speak of that is always mostly quiet when Irben is sent to request new horseshoes.</description>

      <description>Adventures in Sarrolen Day 1 - Setup From the diary of Elder Alfred Duncan We&amp;rsquo;ve been here fifty years. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s as far back as any of us can remember. Some of us have been here the entire memory, and they were adults then. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. Some of those born the first year of our memory look younger than some of the now dead looked when we first remember.</description>
