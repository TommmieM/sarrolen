Within, the normal speaking, orating, convincing, and arguing was not to be had. The town had managed to come to the gravest of circumstances. Children were being harmed by beings that could only be described as monsters, though they termed it as “hunched men” to the people of the town to avoid a panic. Somehow, the true nature of these beasts was becoming known. Each member of the Council had been getting told in the streets that something must be done in regards to the injuries sustained by Jenni Harper.\nUnknown to them, this had been the work of one of their own. Elder Alfred decided that some panics were warranted, and deserved more attention than was normally afforded by the glacial pace of the governing body of the town. Through his personal network of trusted people (every member had such a network, though none would admit to it), Alfred had sent out rumors and tales of the assault as had been able to be ascertained since Jenni was still not concious. These rumors told of a tribe of grey-greeen men, waist high to an adult, smaller even than the local Halflings, that attacked viciously and without mercy or regard for the age of whom they sliced into.\nElder Alfred had finally been able to convince the rest of the council. Jessi’s injuries were the bridge too far. An expedition would be put together in order to survey the Veil and find where these hunched men were coming from. Ord, the son of their esteemed sheriff, was appointed to lead this expedition, and tasked to find those willing to undergo such a trek.\nOver me. After the announcement, indeed, while the Council meeting was still being adjourned, the secrecy was broken. The town knew of the expedition. While it was what they all wanted, several able-bodied men hid. Tales of terrible foes with skin from a grave and swords without regard for the rules of a fair fight did not excite folks whose entire exposure to violence was after too spicy a meal, and even then they were on the receiving end of the violence.\nBefore the meeting had begun, Ord and his father knew what the decision was going to be. Each of the Council members had visited them beforehand, as discreetly as they could muster, and told them of what their decision was. The sherrif took up his normal place of looking out at the town square to keep the secrecy of the Council, while Ord remained in their home next door to the hall. While the meeting progressed in near silence, he went about the solemn work of preparing himself as well as he could for the work he was to be handed. He packed up his meager gear, hoping he would be able to scrounge extra rations before leaving, and waited for the doors to open to announce the decision to the people.\nA knock sounded on his door. It was the local scoundrel, Acca, standing in his threshhold with a determined look upon her face. “Is it true?” left her lips almost before he finished opening the door.\n“What are you talking about?”\n“Are you being sent to the Veil?”\n“Did I miss the announcement?” Ord was concerned that in his contemplation, he had missed the call to gathering.\n“No call has happened. There doesn’t need to be. Everyone is talking about the trip to the veil that you are supposed to be leading.”\n“What? Who-”\nShe cut him off. “Enough of the bullshit, is it happening or not?”\n“Why does it matter to you?”\n“My father is out there. If there’s to be an expedition, one way or another, I’m going to be in on it. Besides, if those things are half what they say, you’re going to need a scout, and I dare you to name one person in this town better than me at going unseen.”\nOrd’s shoulders visibly sagged. She was right. There is no one better in town at going about without notice. Truth be told, Acca was on the short list of recruits, anyway, but he hoped he could have found anyone else willing to fill the role. Given what he knew, however, she deserved it.\n“You know he is probably dead already, right? You’re going out there just to find disappointment.”\n“I’m going out there to find my father. Either he returns home, or he gets a proper burial, either way this injustice ends.”\n The gathering was called shortly after, and the citizen turnout was much thinner than usual. Ord knew at that point that his work was going to be cut out for him. None of those who were of age or shape to undertake the duty before them were around. It seemed his choosing would be difficult if he were going to be required to track everyone down. From what he knew of Acca, she may be able to help him before they even reached the forest’s edge. Then a peculiar thing happened.\n“I’d like to volunteer to go along with you, Ord.”\nTurning, Ord saw Diera, the daughter of a local farmer, her golden hair rimmed in the light of the setting sun. She did not look the kind to be able to undertake such a task, though, and Ord wasted no time in saying so.\n“If I can find no others, but seriously, Diera, you hardly look the type that can make a days long trek that may well end in a fight with armed foes. I think you are best served continuing to help you mother with your brother’s care.”\nAt his words, Diera’s face took on a depondent tone. “No!” she said, perhaps a bit abruptly. “I don’t think so. I really think I can help. I read. Better than anyone else. It may not be much good at taking down an opponent, but if these hunched beings are indeed men, perhaps they have writings. If we know more about them, we may be able to form a better defense.”\n“If I can find no one else, Diera. Now if you will excuse us, we need to head to the temple.”\n“Us?” It was as though she just realized that Acca had not dispersed with the rest of the crowd. “She’s going? That decides it, if the thief can go, then so can I. I’ll gather my things. When are we leaving?”\nFor the second time in an hour, Ord’s shoulders bent in upon him. Acca, if she registered the slight, did not seem to notice.\n“We leave tomorrow. My father is preparing a seeing off tonight at the Discreet Crows. We meet there, and sleep there. If there is anyone you wish to say goodbye to, do so before you arrive tonight.”\n The Temple of the Nameless stood with the doors open. They didn’t even need to knock. The leader of the Temple, Tarvias, was a Council Elder, and apparently prepared the rest of the clerics before leaving. When Ord and Acca approached, several of the holy sect were gathered before the open doors. At their center, receiving blessings and laurels was the orphan, Irben. The solemn look on his face reinforced what they already knew. The church had decided on who was to be their tribute to the cause of investigating the Veil.\nIrben made his way to the duo. “Looks like somehow, I’ve finally come to find a family outside these doors, in a manner.”\n“Speak for yourself. I’ve already got a family. I’m just looking to put it back together.”\nIrben smiled at Acca, “I pray that this journey brings us all closer to our wishes, dear Acca.”\nIf anything, the welcoming words from a member of the same Temple that contained a member of the Council seemed to irk Acca. In truth, it made her more convinced that their words were hypocrisy.\n“We leave at dawn,” informed Ord, “you are free to remain here tonight, if you’d like to say any good byes.”\n“My farewells are done, sir. Until we return with answers, and perhaps some clarity from the Nameless Ones as to why this is happening, I am yours to lead.”\n“Well, good then,” Acca added, “Then we have enough, let’s go get some food in us and prepare for the Veil.”\n“There’s one more I’d like to talk to about coming along. You are a good hunter, Acca, but we will need more than meat to survive if we are out there too long.”\n“You don’t mean…”\nOrd simply turned, walking in the direction Acca was hoping he wouldn’t.\n She was scratching at the dirt when they arrived. The tulips weren’t going to plant themselves, after all. Older than all of them, even though only waist height to Ord. Poppy was satisfied in this moment. Sure, there was a call to gather that she had missed, but she was barely out of childhood, and didn’t care much for the cares of the rest of the town. After all, they refused to treat her with the respect she deserved simply because she was shorter. They still lined up for her mushrooms, soups, and cloths, though. Same as they do with all of her kind.\n“Good day, Poppy. We did not see you at the gathering. Have you heard the news?”\n“No. Your news doesn’t concern us. You all will do as you always do. As per the agreement, you do as you will, leave us to our will, that is the way it is.”\n“I know you heard about young Jenni Harper?” Ord’s question caught Poppy and caused her to pause her gardening. Of course she had heard of the poor girl. After all, Poppy had found her. Jessi was concious when found, but at the sight of Poppy, the girl seemed to respond with a fear beyond reason, fainted, and had not woken up since. Was that a fortnight ago?\n“We are going to find what happened. We are going to the Veil to find where these monsters come from.”\n“So you aren’t like them? You don’t blame me?”\n“No one blames you. You are a hell of a fighter, Poppy, but you’ve never struck without being swung on. That is why I’m here now.\n“I’m leading the search to the Veil. I’d like it if you joined me. If we are going to make it, we are going to need food, and we are going to need a fist. You match that description to the letter.”\nPoppy seemed to think hard, but only for a moment. After all, as hard as she was to the humans, the child was never anything other than an attentive ear. If jessi pulled through this, she may make a decent gardener, for a human.\n“OK.”\n Word of the completion of Ord’s group spread seemingly as fast as the word of the decision of the council, and the Discreet Crows was filled with dignified and serious well-wishers before they could get back to the square. Diera waited for them, a package tied with a bit of twine sat before her on the bar.\nFriends clapped thier shoulders. Even friends that they hadn’t realized they had. Families cried at the knowledge that no one that was banished to the Veil ever returned. While the troupe wasn’t being banished, the Veil was still the Veil. Even Ord’s father, normally as stoic and placid an emotional well as there ever was, appeared to have a bit more shine to his eyes as he bid his son a restful sleep. Diera’s mother tried tearfully to talk her daughter out of the trip. Acca’s mother seemed as stony as Acca herself, offering her daughter only two pieces of advice. The first being that the reunion with her father will be wonderful, the second, a tempered warning that the reunion may not be on Sarrolen. Irben received a final blessing. Poppy seemed to have the entirety of the Outskirts at her table most of the night, downing pints and eating heartily. Nothing appeared to dampen their spirits to the humans, but the Halflings knew the severity of the task at hand, and determined to meet it with fine spirit in order to intimidate it in their own way.\nAfter all the festivities, such as they were, had conceded to the lateness of the hour, the group all had packages similar to Diera’s. A square of linen, cured with beeswax, tied with hempen twine, and containing rations enough to see them each through to a week.\nSleep did not come easily that night, and eventually they found themselves alone with the dwarf that kept the Crows. “Be careful out there. I don’t remember how I got these scars,” he said, pointing at his own face, “but I don’t wish it on you. Had I my left leg, I’d be going with you…” His words faded before he could finish his thought as tears took even him.\n","wordCount":"2170","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-03T17:32:32-07:00","dateModified":"2023-01-03T17:32:32-07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tommie Matherne"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://sarrolen.netlify.com/posts/day-3-getting-the-party-together/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Adventures in Sarrolen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://sarrolen.netlify.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script>

<p>The Council House was in use. Within, the normal speaking, orating, convincing, and arguing was not to be had. The town had managed to come to the gravest of circumstances. Children were being harmed by beings that could only be described as monsters, though they termed it as &ldquo;hunched men&rdquo; to the people of the town to avoid a panic.

<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself. I&rsquo;ve already got a family. I&rsquo;m just looking to put it back together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irben smiled at Acca, &ldquo;I pray that this journey brings us all closer to our wishes, dear Acca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If anything, the welcoming words from a member of the same Temple that contained a member of the Council seemed to irk Acca. In truth, it made her more convinced that their words were hypocrisy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We leave at dawn,&rdquo; informed Ord, &ldquo;you are free to remain here tonight, if you&rsquo;d like to say any good byes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My farewells are done, sir. Until we return with answers, and perhaps some clarity from the Nameless Ones as to why this is happening, I am yours to lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good then,&rdquo; Acca added, &ldquo;Then we have enough, let&rsquo;s go get some food in us and prepare for the Veil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one more I&rsquo;d like to talk to about coming along. You are a good hunter, Acca, but we will need more than meat to survive if we are out there too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ord simply turned, walking in the direction Acca was hoping he wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<hr>
<p>She was scratching at the dirt when they arrived. The tulips weren&rsquo;t going to plant themselves, after all. Older than all of them, even though only waist height to Ord. Poppy was satisfied in this moment. Sure, there was a call to gather that she had missed, but she was barely out of childhood, and didn&rsquo;t care much for the cares of the rest of the town. After all, they refused to treat her with the respect she deserved simply because she was shorter. They still lined up for her mushrooms, soups, and cloths, though. Same as they do with all of her kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, Poppy. We did not see you at the gathering. Have you heard the news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Your news doesn&rsquo;t concern us. You all will do as you always do. As per the agreement, you do as you will, leave us to our will, that is the way it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you heard about young Jenni Harper?&rdquo; Ord&rsquo;s question caught Poppy and caused her to pause her gardening. Of course she had heard of the poor girl. After all, Poppy had found her. Jessi was concious when found, but at the sight of Poppy, the girl seemed to respond with a fear beyond reason, fainted, and had not woken up since. Was that a fortnight ago?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to find what happened. We are going to the Veil to find where these monsters come from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you aren&rsquo;t like them? You don&rsquo;t blame me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one blames you. You are a hell of a fighter, Poppy, but you&rsquo;ve never struck without being swung on. That is why I&rsquo;m here now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leading the search to the Veil. I&rsquo;d like it if you joined me. If we are going to make it, we are going to need food, and we are going to need a fist. You match that description to the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poppy seemed to think hard, but only for a moment. After all, as hard as she was to the humans, the child was never anything other than an attentive ear. If jessi pulled through this, she may make a decent gardener, for a human.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Word of the completion of Ord&rsquo;s group spread seemingly as fast as the word of the decision of the council, and the Discreet Crows was filled with dignified and serious well-wishers before they could get back to the square. Diera waited for them, a package tied with a bit of twine sat before her on the bar.</p>
<p>Friends clapped thier shoulders. Even friends that they hadn&rsquo;t realized they had. Families cried at the knowledge that no one that was banished to the Veil ever returned. While the troupe wasn&rsquo;t being banished, the Veil was still the Veil. Even Ord&rsquo;s father, normally as stoic and placid an emotional well as there ever was, appeared to have a bit more shine to his eyes as he bid his son a restful sleep. Diera&rsquo;s mother tried tearfully to talk her daughter out of the trip. Acca&rsquo;s mother seemed as stony as Acca herself, offering her daughter only two pieces of advice. The first being that the reunion with her father will be wonderful, the second, a tempered warning that the reunion may not be on Sarrolen. Irben received a final blessing. Poppy seemed to have the entirety of the Outskirts at her table most of the night, downing pints and eating heartily. Nothing appeared to dampen their spirits to the humans, but the Halflings knew the severity of the task at hand, and determined to meet it with fine spirit in order to intimidate it in their own way.</p>
<p>After all the festivities, such as they were, had conceded to the lateness of the hour, the group all had packages similar to Diera&rsquo;s. A square of linen, cured with beeswax, tied with hempen twine, and containing rations enough to see them each through to a week.</p>
<p>Sleep did not come easily that night, and eventually they found themselves alone with the dwarf that kept the Crows. &ldquo;Be careful out there. I don&rsquo;t remember how I got these scars,&rdquo; he said, pointing at his own face, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t wish it on you. Had I my left leg, I&rsquo;d be going with you&mldr;&rdquo; His words faded before he could finish his thought as tears took even him.</p>
